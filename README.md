## Installation
 Download the corresponding binary for your platform:
 - [x86 Linux](build/bsky-mcp-linux-amd64)
 - [Intel Mac](build/bsky-mcp-darwin-amd64)
 - [M-Series (ARM) Mac](build/bsky-mcp-darwin-arm64)
 - [x86 Windows](build/bsky-mcp-darwin-amd64)

 ### Building from source
 Requirements:
 - [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

 To build, run
  ```bash
  $ go build .
  ```
  Building for all platforms is currently done through a bash script (and also requires Go):
  ```bash
  $ ./build.sh
  ```
  This will create binaries for all platforms in the `build` directory.

## Usage

### Environmental Variables
  `ATPROTO_DID`: Your Bluesky DID (e.g., `did:plc:z72i7hd...` or `did:web:example.com`)
   - You can get this by going to [PDSls](https://pdsls.dev), typing in your handle, and clicking "Copy DID" (or going to the DID Doc tab).

  `ATPROTO_APP_PASSWORD`: Your Bluesky app password (e.g., `c7hp-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)
   - You can get this by going to the [Bluesky App Passwords page](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords) and creating a new app password.
   - Don't use your regular passwordâ€”it'll work, but it's bad practice :(.

### Claude Desktop
  Add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "bsky-mcp": {
        "command": "/path/to/binary/bsky-mcp-<YOUR PLATFORM>",
        "env": {
          "ATPROTO_DID": "your_did_here"
          "ATPROTO_APP_PASSWORD": "your_app_password_here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
